# Snapdrop

> WARNING: This is a fork! Check below the comparison between this and upstream.

[Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net): local file sharing in your browser. Inspired by Apple's Airdrop.

#### Snapdrop is built with the following awesome technologies:

- Vanilla HTML5 / ES6 / CSS3 frontend
- [WebRTC](http://webrtc.org/) / [WebSockets](http://www.websocket.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) backend
- [Progressive Web App](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_App)

Have any questions? Read our [FAQ](/docs/faq.md).

You can [host your own instance with Docker](/docs/local-dev.md).
